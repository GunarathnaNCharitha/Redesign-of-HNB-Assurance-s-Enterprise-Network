## Project Overview
As Lead Engineer, I directed the **redesign of HNB Assuranceâ€™s enterprise network** across headquarters and multiple branches. The project modernized core infrastructure, consolidated firewalls, and enhanced both performance and security for a large financial services provider in Sri Lanka.
